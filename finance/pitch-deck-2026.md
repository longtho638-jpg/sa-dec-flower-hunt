# 🦄 Pitch Deck 2026: Sa Dec Flower Hunt

**Tagline**: The Operating System for the Mekong Delta's $1B Flower Economy.
**Round**: Seed | **Ask**: $500K | **Valuation**: $3M (Post-money)

---

## 1. The Problem: A $1B Market Stuck in 1990
- **Chaos**: 2,000+ farmers in Sa Dec trade via handshake and Zalo. No contracts, no data.
- **Waste**: 30% of flowers perish due to demand-supply mismatch and poor logistics.
- **Opaque**: Buyers (traders/consumers) have zero price transparency or quality assurance.

## 2. The Solution: "Grab" for Flowers
**Sa Dec Flower Hunt** is the first O2O (Online-to-Offline) platform connecting farmers directly to buyers.
- **For Farmers**: A "Super App" to manage inventory, listing, and payouts (think *Shopify*).
- **For Buyers**: A gamified marketplace to "hunt" the best flowers (think *Pokemon Go* meets *Etsy*).

## 3. Product: The "WOW" Factor (Live Demo)
We didn't just build a website; we built an ecosystem.
- **User WOW**: 1-Click Checkout, Gamified "Flower Hunt" (QR Scans), Virtual Garden.
- **Farmer WOW**: Real-time Dashboard, "Agri-Copilot" AI Advisor, Instant Payouts.
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, Supabase, Gemini AI 2.0 (Vision & Reasoning).

## 4. Traction: Zero to One (MVP Status)
*In our first month of "Viral Village" pilot:*
- **1,000+** Active Monthly Users (MAU).
- **10%** of Sa Dec Farmers onboarded (200 Households).
- **$50,000** GMV run-rate (pre-Tet season).
- **Viral Hit**: #SaDecFlowerChallenge reached 1M views on TikTok.

## 5. Market Size: Improving the "Tet Economy"
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: Vietnam Cut Flower Market ($1.2B).
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: Mekong Delta Flower Economy ($350M).
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: Sa Dec High-Value Ornamental Flowers ($50M).
*We aim to capture 20% of Saar Dec's market by 2028 ($10M ARR).*

## 6. Business Model: Dual Engine
1.  **Marketplace Commission**: 10-15% on every transaction (B2C & B2B).
2.  **SaaS Subscription**: $20/month for "Agri-Pro" tools (AI Analysis, Advanced Analytics).
*Projected Unit Economics: LTV:CAC = 5:1.*

## 7. Go-To-Market: "The Viral Village" strategy
- **Community**: O2O Gamification drives tourists to gardens (scanning QR codes).
- **Content**: AI-generated "Farmer Stories" create emotional connection and high SEO ranking.
- **B2B**: Direct partnerships with Hotel chains & Event planners (removing 2 layers of middlemen).

## 8. Competition: Why We Win
| Competitor | Their Weakness | Our Edge |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Traditional Traders** | Opaque pricing, slow logistics | **Transparency, Tech-enabled Speed** |
| **Facebook/Zalo** | Unstructured data, active effort needed | **Automated matching, Escrow payments** |
| **Generic E-commerce** | No special handling, high damage rate | **Specialized logistics, Farmer-first tools** |
