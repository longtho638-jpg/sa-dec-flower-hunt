# 🛡️ GOVERNANCE & RISK (PHASE 6 EXECUTION)
*Generated by BizPlan CLI: Agents 15 (Metrics), 17 (Risk), 19 (Benchmarks)*

## 1. 📊 Viral Metrics Dashboard (AARRR)
**Objective**: Measure the success of the "December Festival Launch".

### Acquisition (The Viral Loop)
*   **Metric**: "Scan-to-Signup Rate".
*   **Target**: >30% of visitors who scan the QR Code must complete a signup (Name + Zalo).
*   **Benchmark**: Industry standard for QR campaigns is 15%. We aim for double due to "Immediate Reward" (Voucher).

### Retention (The Sticker Stickiness)
*   **Metric**: "Day-30 Plant Survival Rate".
*   **How**: Users upload a photo of their "Climate Warrior" plant on Day 30 to unlock a 2nd Voucher.
*   **Target**: >80% survival (Proves the "Heat Resilience" claim).

## 2. ⚠️ Risk Register: "Platform Traps"
**The dangers of pivoting from Shop to Platform.**

### Risk 1: "Phantom Inventory" (Critical)
*   **Scenario**: Farmer lists 50 pots on "Farm2Phone", but sells them offline to a trader before we get there.
*   **Impact**: We sell to customer -> Cannot fulfill -> Brand destroyed.
*   **Mitigation**:
    1.  **"Smart Deposit"**: We pay Farmer 30% deposit *immediately* when they list (locks inventory).
    2.  **"Qing Ming Rule"**: Inventory sync must happen daily via Zalo bot.

### Risk 2: "Heat Map Failure" (Tech)
*   **Scenario**: AI recommends a plant, but it dies in the user's balcony.
*   **Mitigation**: "The 100% Green Guarantee". If a Climate Warrior plant dies in 30 days (and you watered it), we replace it for free. No questions asked.

## 3. 📉 Industry Benchmarks (SaaS)
**Where we need to be for Series A.**

*   **Growth Rate**: 300% YoY (Target: $500k ARR).
*   **Gross Margin**:
    *   Direct Sales: 40% (Inventory Heavy).
    *   Platform Sales: 80% (Pure Tech).
    *   *Blended Target*: 50%+.
*   **Rule of 40**: Growth % + Margin % should be > 40. We are targeting 300% + 50% = 350 (Super Healthy).
