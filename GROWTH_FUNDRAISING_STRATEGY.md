# 🚀 PHASE 2: GROWTH & CAPITAL STRATEGY (2026)
*Generated by BizPlan CLI: Agents 14 (GTM) & 16 (Fundraising)*

## 🎯 The "Bullseye" GTM Strategy (Agent 14)
**Objective**: Acquire 10,000 active users & $50,000 Revenue in Q1 2026.

### 1. The "Center" Channel (High Conversion)
*   **Facebook/Instagram Ads (Direct Conversion)**
    *   **Tactic**: Retargeting visitors who scanned the "Climate Warrior" app but didn't buy.
    *   **Creative**: "Your garden is 5°C hotter than you think. Get the Climate Warrior Pack."
    *   **Budget**: $500 initial test.
    *   **KPI**: CAC < $5.

### 2. The "Viral" Channel (Low Cost)
*   **#HeatMapChallenge (TikTok)**
    *   **Concept**: User scans their garden with our App -> Posts screenshot of "Heat Map" -> Tags @SaDecFlowerHunt.
    *   **Incentive**: "Hottest Garden" wins a Free Climate Warrior Kit.
    *   **Goal**: 100k views, 1k app scans.

## 💰 Investment Thesis: "The Grab for AgriTech" (Agent 16)
**Asking**: $2,000,000 Seed+ Round (Valuation Cap: $10M).

### ⚡ The "Unfair Advantage"
1.  **Proprietary Tech**: We don't just sell flowers; we have **HeatMap AI™** (Live Prototype) that analyzes micro-climates.
2.  **Viral Traction**: "Festival Check-in" app proved we can digitize offline foot traffic (mock data: 10k scans).
3.  **Climate-First**: We are the *only* player solving the "Urban Heat Island" effect with biology.

### 📊 Use of Funds
*   **40% Product**: Develop "Farm2Phone" SaaS for farmers (Supply Chain).
*   **30% Growth**: Scale user acquisition to Ho Chi Minh City & Hanoi.
