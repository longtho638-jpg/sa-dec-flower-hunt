## 1. 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We are pivoting from a traditional "E-commerce Shop" to an **"AgriTech Platform (Marketplace + SaaS)"**.
*   **The Problem**: Urban Heat Island effect kills 70% of balcony plants in HCMC.
*   **The Solution**: **"Climate Warrior" Series** (Heat-resistant flowers >45°C) + **HeatMap AI™** (Scanner App).
*   **The Goal**: $500,000 USD Revenue in 2026 (Seed Stage).
*   **The Ask**: Raising **$2,000,000 Seed+** to scale inventory and "Farm2Phone" technology.

## 2. 📱 PRODUCT STRATEGY (LIVE APPS)
We are not an "Idea". We are "Live".

### A. The "Viral Hook": Festival Check-in App
*   **Status**: **LIVE** (Deployed for Dec Festival).
*   **Function**: Gamified Check-in -> Collect Leads -> Unlock Vouchers.
*   **Goal**: Acquire 10,000 users/leads in 7 days.

### B. The "Core Product": Climate Scanner
*   **Status**: **LIVE** (`/climate-warrior`).
*   **Function**: Uses Camera to scan "Balcony Heat" -> Recommends specific Sa Dec flowers that survive.
*   **USP**: "Don't buy a flower. Buy a survivor."

## 3. 📈 GROWTH STRATEGY (GTM)
**Objective**: Acquire 10,000 Paying Users ($50 LTV).

### The "Bullseye" Channel: Facebook/TikTok Ads
*   **Tactic**: Retarget users who scanned but didn't buy.
*   **Creative Hook**: "Your balcony is 36°C. Most plants will die. These won't."
*   **Budget**: $0.20 CPC Target.

### The "Viral" Channel: #HeatMapChallenge
*   **Mechanic**: User posts a screenshot of their "Hot Balcony" -> Wins a free "Warrior Kit".
